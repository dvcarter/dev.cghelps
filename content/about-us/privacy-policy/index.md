Accordingly, we have developed this privacy policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate, disclose and otherwise make use of personal information. We have outlined our privacy policy below.
•   We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned.
•   Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we will identify the purposes for which information is being collected.
•   We will collect and use personal information solely for fulfilling those purposes specified by us and for other ancillary purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.
•   Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.
•   We will protect personal information by using reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

Please recognize that, even though Common Ground employs reasonable security measures, any personal or private information that you provide on the internet is subject to an inherent risk of unauthorized access and distribution by third parties. Please limit accordingly the extent that you elect to share any personal or private information with Common Ground over the internet, and please do not upload to or post any information on the Common Ground website that would constitute a private health record.

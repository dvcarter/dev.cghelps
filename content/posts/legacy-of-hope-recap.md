Common Ground's 6th Annual Legacy of Hope Breakfast proved to be a fun and successful event! 
On Tuesday, May 2, welcomed more than 200 guests to learn about the organization and its impact in the community.
The fundraiser was centered around the organization’s need to expand their mobile services and the “Chat and Text” helpline service.
Take a look at our recap video, from the event!

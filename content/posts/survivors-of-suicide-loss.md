Join us at our Survivors of Suicide Loss Support Group.
The group provides outreach, support, and information to those who have lost a loved one to suicide. The open group offers comfort, strength, and hope,
shared with other survivors and trained peer professionals.

Sessions are held from 7pm to 9pm on the first and third Monday of each month.
The group is free to join, and all are welcome!

For more information, contact Amelia Lehto at 1-248-451-2613 or email alehto@cghelps.org

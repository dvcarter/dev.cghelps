      </p>
      <p> We invite you to get to know Common Ground a little better!</p>
      <p style="margin-right: 20px;"> The presentation consists of inspirational stories that get to the heart
       of Common Ground's key impact areas: Responding to Crisis, Providing 
       Safety and Advocacy, and Building Communities of Support.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 20px;"> You will come away with a better understanding of how critical 
      Common Ground is to our community. We Are not asking for contributions,
      but we will follow up with you a few days after the presentation to 
       gather comments and feedback. It will easily be the best hour of your day.
